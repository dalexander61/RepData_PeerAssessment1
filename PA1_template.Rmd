```

## Loading and Preprocessing the Data


```{r}
library(plyr)
library(ggplot2)
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date)

```

## What is the mean total number of steps taken each day?
Make a histogram of the total number of steps each day.
```{r}
## calculate daily steps
day_act <- ddply(activity, .(date), summarize, total=sum(steps))


g <- ggplot(day_act, aes(x=total))
g <- g + geom_histogram(fill="green", binwidth=1000)
g <- g + labs(title = "Total Steps per Day", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency")
print(g)

```

### Mean of total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
mean(day_act$total, na.rm = TRUE)
```


### Median of total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
median(day_act$total, na.rm = TRUE)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern
### Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
```{r}
interval_act <- ddply(activity, .(interval), summarize, avgsteps=mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE))
g <- ggplot(interval_act, aes(x=interval, y=avgsteps))
g <- g + geom_line(color="green")
g <- g + labs(title = "Average Total Steps", y = "Average Steps", x = "Interval")
print(g)
```

### Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
```{r}
interval_act[which.max(interval_act$avgsteps),]
```


## Imputing Missing Values
### Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset
```{r}
nrow(activity[is.na(activity$steps),])
```

### Use the Mean for each interval to fill in the missing values in the dataset. 
Create a new data set equal to the original data set but with the missing data filled in.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
fullact <- activity
fullact <- fullact %>% group_by(interval) %>% mutate(avgsteps = mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE))
fullact[is.na(fullact$steps),]$steps <- fullact[is.na(fullact$steps),]$avgsteps
head(fullact)
```


## Make a new histogram of total steps taken each day.
```{r}
nday_act <- ddply(fullact, .(date), summarize, total=sum(steps))

g <- ggplot(nday_act, aes(x=total))
g <- g + geom_histogram(fill="green", binwidth=1000)
g <- g + labs(title = "Total Steps per Day", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency")
print(g)
```

### Mean of total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
mean(nday_act$total)
```


### Median of total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
median(nday_act$total)
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r}
fullact <- fullact %>% mutate(dayofweek = weekdays(date))

fullact[fullact$dayofweek=="Saturday",]$dayofweek <- "weekend"
fullact[fullact$dayofweek=="Sunday",]$dayofweek <- "weekend"
fullact[fullact$dayofweek!="weekend",]$dayofweek <- "weekday"

head(fullact)
```

### Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekdays or weekends (y-axis). 
See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.

```{r}

g <- ggplot(fullact, aes(x=interval, y=avgsteps))
g <- g + geom_line(color="green")
g <- g + labs(title = "Average Total Steps", y = "Average Steps", x = "Interval")
g <- g + facet_wrap(~dayofweek, nrow=2, ncol=1)
print(g)

```
